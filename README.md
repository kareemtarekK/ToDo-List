# ToDo-List
Aplication ToDo List created with javascript , it can save information , drop it or clear this info
### <hr></br>This Application is very simple and very famous , it is created by many language ,
### but Thanks to God I created it by javascript only as a programming language
The idea of this application you can store your information in it , like your important information [templetes - (id , email , serialNumber , etc...) , Dates , sections in university , and any things.... ] .
### 1- To start using application you will see controlling list in front of you , you can add any tasks you want like above...after clicking on add button.
### 2- then after adding your tasks you have three buttons [clear , drop_selected , delete].
### 3- delete button you can use it when you want delete your task but this task will not deleted from localStorage as I didn`t add this feature in application.
### 4- drop_selected ..... when you can use this button , you can use it after finishing your task after clicking on task (you will see this task with red color with line througth it) then click on drop_selected theses selected tasks will be removed but alse not from localStorage.
### 5- clear button absoultaly you can use it when you want to remove all tasks , and this tasks will be removed from localStorage.
### 6- (Hint => notice if you entered identical tasks you will find message tell you duplicating tasks you should enter a different task )
### 7- This application is responsive in [mobiles , pc , labtop].
